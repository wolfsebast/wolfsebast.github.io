		I built this lovely site using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> from scratch. 
		I call this website my chill corner, this is where I can write anything I want or share some of my thoughts. 
		I hope you enjoy reading my articles and feel free to visit my <a href="{{ site.url }}/services.html">Services</a> page if you're interested in making a blog.
